Notes:
- Keep images roughly vertical (e.g., 1200x1600) to fit the comic card layout.
- Filenames must match p1.png ... p6.png to auto-appear in the story cards.
- You can use .jpg or .webp if preferred; update src/data/quests.json image_path accordingly.
- Each image should be vibrant, comic book style with bold outlines and expressive characters.
